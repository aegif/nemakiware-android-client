# Introduction #

Android CMIS Browser tend to be a multi-language Application. But for time reason (and vocabulary too...), we need contributors to translate this app in your own language.

For this reason, we create a public google doc with all key-value pair present in Android CMIS Browser. You can create, modify or delete translated value. You are free !

This doc is avialable at this url : **http://bit.ly/dq2d10**

## Language available ##

**ENG, FR , DE**
